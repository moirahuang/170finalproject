# construct a dictionary mapping each person to the rowdy groups they're in

# iterate through the buses and construct an array with the number of friends they have on the buses
# ILP to pick the bus with the max heuristic (based on vectors)
# heuristic is # of friendships created - factor * potential rowdy groups created (but make -infinity if a rowdy group is created)

# simulated anealing to swap for best solution
